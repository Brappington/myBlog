I’m writing this blog so that I can enforce some personal accountability. This year I endeavour to write a monthly blog that talks about the progress I have made that month in 4 areas: **Career**, **Learning**, **Reading** and **Blue.**
## Career
While I don’t require a job this year, I’d like to aim for one. Once I have settled I am. hooping too each the job search.
## Coding
I’d like to master Python, learn JavaScript and a JavaScript framework. Build out my portfolio and have 5 solid projects. My work can be found at [Brappington (Jack Powell) · GitHub](https://github.com/Brappington)
My initial Projects:
- My Blog
- My personal Website 
- MP Twitter (updating it to include the cabinet and shadow cabinet
- Tidal App (To learn a cross platform framework)
- Local App solving local problem (To learn more about finding problems and creating solutions)

## Reading
Without putting targets on myself id like to average reading a book a month and write a short review to see what I learnt from it. Can include coding books, nonfiction or fiction. I have just finished Identity and will review it in my February blog post.
Initial list:
- Identity by Francis Fukuyama
- 52 times Britain was a belled by James Felton
- Children of time by Adrian Tchaikovsky
- Surveillance capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff
- Dishonesty is the Second-Best Policy: And Other Rules to Live by David Mitchell
- The ministry of truth by Dorian Lynsky
- Your first year in code by Isaac Lyman
- 21 lessons for the 21st century by Yuval Noah Harari

## Blue
I want Blue to have a happy and healthy 1st year and will probably just post nice pictures of her, her weight and age for each blog post.
